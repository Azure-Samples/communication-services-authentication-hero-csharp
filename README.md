## Overview

In order to properly implement Azure Communication Services solutions, developers must start by putting in place the correct infrastructure to perform key actions for the communications lifecycle. These actions include authenticating users since the Azure Communication Services are identity-agnostic.

This is an ACS solution sample to provide a guidance establishing best practices on a simple use case to bring your own identity (**BYOI**) to the Azure Communication Services by storing the mapping between Azure AD and ACS users. The solution guides below:

- Have a trusted backend service that will create ACS identities and issue access tokens.
- Have this trusted service authenticate users and maintain a mapping between a Contoso identity and an ACS identity.

> An ACS Solutions - Authentication Sample (javascript version) can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-authentication-hero-javascript).

Additional documentation for this sample can be found on [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/samples/calling-hero-sample).

Before contributing to this sample, please read our [contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Features
