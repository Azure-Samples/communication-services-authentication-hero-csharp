# React single-page application built with MSAL React and Microsoft identity platform to demonstrate the Azure Communication Services Auth sample

\*This is a very simple client based on the autogenerated react single page app from the Azure Active Directory registered apps QuickStart. This should not be used for production and serves as a sample to see how the backend can be called.

## Pre-Requisite
 - Backend server set up and running. (If deployed to a non local environment, modify SERVER_ADDRESS in acsAuthApiCaller.js)
 - Single page client app registered on Azure Active Directory. 
 - Populate the authConfig.js file with the clientId, authority, and redirectUri values from the client app registration.
 - Populate the authConfig.js file with the loginRequest Scopes value from the server app registration - > Expose an API -> scopes.

## To run this client
1. run `npm install`
2. run `npm start`
3. navigate to http://localhost:3000/
4. click on **Sign in** then use the popup to login with a valid user. 
5. click on **Join Default Call** to join a call using the displayed randomly generated GUID, or use the **AAD Access Token** to directly call the backend API.
6. To join a call with another device, share the GUID and enter it in the text box of the client wanting to join the same call.
