# React single-page application built with MSAL React and Microsoft identity platform to demonstrate the ACSAuth sample

\*This is a very simple client based on the autogenerated react single page app from the Azure Active Directory registered apps QuickStart. This should not be used for production and sereves as a sample to see how the backend can be called.

## Pre-Req

 - Single page client app registered on Azure Active Directory .
 - Populate the authConfig.js file with the clientId, authority, redirectUri, and loginRequest Scope values from the app registrations (server and client).
## To run this client
1. Run ``npm install``
2. Run ``npm start``
3. Navigate to "http://localhost:3000/"
4. Click sign in then use the popup to login with a valid user. 
5. Click Join Default Call to join a call using the displayed randomly generated GUID.
6. To join a call with another device, share the GUID and enter it in the text box of the client wanting to join the same call.
