## Get Set up

### Prerequisites for Development Environment Setup

- Install [.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/).
- (Recommended) Install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

### Cloning the repo

Clone the repo: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-authentication-hero-csharp

```shell
# HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-authentication-hero-csharp.git

# SSH
git clone git@github.com:Azure-Samples/communication-services-authentication-hero-csharp.git
```

### Installing dependencies

Navigate to the project `src` directory and install dependencies for all packages and samples:

```shell
# Navigate to the src directory
cd communication-services-authentication-hero-csharp/src

# restore dependencies
dotnet restore
```

>**Note:** this may take some time the first time it runs

## Build Authentication Server Sample

Once set up, you can run the following commands to build the repo.

```shell
# Navigate to the project root directory
cd communication-services-authentication-hero-csharp/

# Builds the project and its dependencies into a set of binaries
dotnet build
```

>**Note:**
>
> 1. This may take some time the first time it runs.
> 2. To learn more dotnet commands, please visit [.NET CLI overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/)
> 3. You can also build the repo using Visual Studio:
>    1. Right click on the solution `ACSAuthenticationSolution.sln` in **Solution Explorer**.
>    2. Click on **Build Solution**

## Run Authentication Server Sample

### Prerequisites to run the sample
To be able to run this sample locally, you will first need to follow those [prerequisites](../../README.md#prerequisites).

### Update the `appSettings.json` File

Before running the sample, you will need to replace the values in the  `appSettings.json` file:

1. Replace `connectionString` and `scopes` for the Communication Services
2. Replace `clientId`, `tenantId` and `clientSecret` for the Azure Active Directory.

>**Note:** Values of `clientId`, `tenantId` and `clientSecret` are all from your `auther-server-sample-webApi`. If you created the app registrations in [prerequisites](#prerequisites-to-run-the-sample) using app creation scripts, then you should already have these values updated in your local repository.

### Run the App

In order to run the Azure Communication Services Authentication Server sample,

1. Go to the project `src` directory.

   ```shell
   # navigate to the src directory
   cd communication-services-authentication-hero-csharp/src
   ```

2. Run the following command.

   ```shell
   # Start the server
   dotnet run
   ```

   > Note: You can also run the selected project using the Visual Studio.

3. We have two ways of testing the backend service
   - Using a manually generated token and calling the server directly
   - Using a sample client

4. Make a GET request to `http://localhost:5000/api/token` with the `access_token` generated at **step 2** of **Generate an Azure Active Directory Token manually** guide as a Authorization Bearer header. Verify you get a response with a successful status code (i.e. 200).

   Please see the two options in detail here [Test deployed service](../test-tools/test-backend-service.md).

5. During local development/testing, if the identity mapping needs to be verified in Graph for `/api/user` and `/api/token` endpoint, please use [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer). Sign in with your Azure Active Directory Identity and verify the response on GET `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/extensions` endpoint.
