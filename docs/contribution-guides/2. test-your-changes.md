## 2. Test Your Changes

After making changes, you should make sure they are working as expected and not breaking the existing unit tests.

Run unit tests locally:
- To run unit tests in VS Code, open the ACSAuthentication.Server.UnitTests, and run the command 'dotnet test'.
- To run unit tests in Visual Studio, open the solution, open up test explorer, and run the tests via the UI.
