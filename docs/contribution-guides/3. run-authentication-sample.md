## 3. Run Authentication Server Sample

### Prerequisites

- Register a Client and Server (Web API) applications in Azure Active Directory (AAD) as part of [On Behalf Of workflow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow). See instructions below
- Update the Server (Web API) application with information from the app registrations

### Create an App Registration for a Server - Register a web API

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.

2. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.

3. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:

   1. In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `auther-server-sample-webApi`.

   2. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only (Microsoft only - Single tenant)** option for who can use or access this application.

   3. Select **Register** to create the application. And it will open your application page once registration is sucessful.

4. In the app's registration screen (**auther-server-sample-webApi** page), 

   1. Navigate to and select the **Certificates & secrets** blade in the left to open the page where we can generate secrets and upload certificates.

      1. In the **Client secrets** section, select **New client secret**  to create a new one.

      2. Type a key description (for instance `app secret`),

      3. Select one of the available key durations (**In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**) as per your security posture.

      4. The generated key value will be displayed when you select the **Add** button. Copy the generated value for use in the steps later.

         > Note: You'll need this key later in your code's configuration files. This key value will not be displayed again, and is not retrievable by any other means, so make sure to note it from the Azure portal before navigating to any other screen or blade.

   2. Navigate to and click on **API permissions** menu item

     1. Click **Add a permission**, and select **Delegated permissions** in **Microsoft Graph**.
     2. Select **User.Read** and **User.ReadWrite.All**, and then click **Add permissions** to save.
     3. select **Grant admin consent** for the Microsoft Graph API call

   3. Navigate to and select the **Expose an API** blade to the left to open the page where you can declare the parameters to expose this app as an API for which client applications can obtain [access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) for.

     1. The first thing that we need to do is to declare the unique [resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) URI that the clients will be using to obtain access tokens for this API. To declare an resource URI, follow the following steps:
        1. Select `Set` next to the **Application ID URI** to generate a URI that is unique for this app.
        2. For this sample, accept the proposed Application ID URI (`api://{clientId}`) by selecting **Save**.

     2. All APIs have to publish a minimum of one [scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code) for the client's to obtain an access token successfully. To publish a scope, select **Add a scope** button open the **Add a scope** screen and Enter the values as indicated below:

        1. For **Scope name**, use `access_as_user`.

        2. Select **Admins and users** options for **Who can consent?**.

        3. For **Admin consent display name** type `Access Microsoft Graph API`.

        4. For **Admin consent description** type `Allows the app to access Microsoft Graph API as the signed-in user.`

        5. For **User consent display name** type `Access Microsoft Graph API`.

        6. For **User consent description** type `Allow the application to access Microsoft Graph API on your behalf.`

        7. Keep **State** as **Enabled**.

        8. Select the **Add scope** button on the bottom to save this scope.

   4. On the left hand side menu, select the `Manifest` blade.

      1. Set `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` property to **2**.

      2. Click on **Save**.

### Create an App Registration for a Client - Register a web app

> Note: This client app registration will be used to manually generate the AAD Token required to call AAD protected Web API as there is no client application in the sample.

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.

2. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.

3. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:

   1. In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `auther-server-sample-webClient`.

   2. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only (Microsoft only - Single tenant)** option for who can use or access this application.
   3. Under **Redirect URI (optional)**, select **Web** and set the redirect URI to `http://localhost:3000`

   3. Select **Register** to create the application. And it will open your application page once registration is sucessful.

4. In the app's registration screen (**auther-server-sample-webClient** page), 

   1. Navigate to and select the **Certificates & secrets** blade in the left to open the page where we can generate secrets and upload certificates.

      1. In the **Client secrets** section, select **New client secret**  to create a new one.

      2. Type a key description (for instance `app secret`),

      3. Select one of the available key durations (**In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**) as per your security posture.

      4. The generated key value will be displayed when you select the **Add** button. Copy the generated value for use in the steps later.

         > Note: You'll need this key later in your code's configuration files. This key value will not be displayed again, and is not retrievable by any other means, so make sure to note it from the Azure portal before navigating to any other screen or blade.

   2. Navigate to and click on **API permissions** menu item to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
      1. Select the **Add a permission** button and then,
      2. Ensure that the **My APIs** tab is selected.
      3. In the list of APIs, select the API `auther-server-sample-webApi`.
      4. In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the `access_as_user` in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
      5. Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

5. Go back to your `auther-server-sample-webApi` app
     - Navigate to and click on **Expose an API**
       - Click on **Add client applications**
         - Past your `auther-server-sample-webClient` application ID
         - Check the corresponding authorized scope box
         - Click on **Add application**

### Create an Azure Communication Services resource

Follow [Quickstart: Create and manage Communication Services resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp) to create an Azure Communication Services resource using Azure Portal.

### Create an `appSettings.ts` File

Before running the sample, you will need to replace the values in the  `appSettings.ts`  file:

1. Use the `appSettings.ts.template` file as an template to generate the  `appSettings.ts`  file.

2. Replace `connectionString` and `scopes` for the Communication Services

3. Replace `clientId`, `tenantId` and `clientSecret` for the Azure Active Directory.

   > Note: Values of `clientId`, `tenantId` and `clientSecret` are all from `auther-server-sample-webApi`

### Generate an Azure AD Token manually

Since the sample does not have a client application, you need to generate Client Azure AD Token manually to make calls to AAD protected backend Web APIs in the ACS Authentication Server sample. You will need an access token using client app registration to call the Web API. In order to get the access token manually, please follow below steps. 

>  Note: If you are integrating a client application, then please ignore these steps as you could test directly via user signing through client application.

**Note:** The `<client app id>` is the application id of the client app registration (`auther-server-sample-webClient`) referred in below requests. The client app in below requests refers the client app registration generally. You can get the `<tenantid>` from the app registration overview page as well. The full scope name of the server api should be used for the scope parameter in the below request (e.g.: "api://1234-5678-abcd-efgh...../access_as_user").

1. Open your browser in private mode and visit the link below 
```
https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenantid>/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=<client appid>&redirect_uri=<redirect_uri from client app>&scope=<server api scope>
```
2. This will prompt you to perform authentication and consent, and it will return a code(which is short lived for 10 minutes) and session_state in the query string. Use that `code` and `session_state` in the following request to get an access token.

``` SHELL
curl --location --request POST 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenantid>/oauth2/v2.0/token' \
--header 'Accept: */*' \
--header 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
--header 'Connection: keep-alive' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--header 'Host: login.microsoftonline.com' \
--header 'accept-encoding: gzip, deflate' \
--header 'cache-control: no-cache' \
--data-urlencode 'redirect_uri=<redirect_uri from client app>' \
--data-urlencode 'client_id=<client appid>' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
--data-urlencode 'code=<code>' \
--data-urlencode 'session_state=<session_state>' \
--data-urlencode 'client_secret=<secret gererated in client app>' \
--data-urlencode 'scope=<server api scope>'
```
> Note: If you are facing issues running the curl command, then try importing(File -> import -> raw text, paste the curl command and continue) the curl command in [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and running it there. 

3. Once you get the `access_token` in the response, now you can jump to the next step to start the server and call `http://localhost:5000/api/token` or `https://localhost:5001/api/token` using the  `access_token` .

### Run the App

In order to run the ACS Authentication Server sample,

1. Go to the project root directory.

   ```shell
   # navigate to the repository
   cd communication-services-authentication-hero-csharp/src
   ```

   

2. Run the following command.

   ```shell
   # Start the server
   dotnet run
   ```

   > Note: You can also run the selected project using the Visual Studio.

3. Make a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/api/token` with the `access_token` generated at **step 2** of **Generate an Azure AD Token manually** as a Authorization Bearer header. Verify you get a successful status code i.e. 200.

   ```shell
   curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:5000/api/token' --header 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>'
   ```

   > Note: If you are facing issues running the curl command, then try importing(File -> import -> raw text, paste the curl command and continue) the curl command in [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and running it there.
