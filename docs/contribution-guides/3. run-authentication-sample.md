## 3. Run Authentication Server Sample

### Prerequisites

- Register a Client and Server (Web API) applications in Azure Active Directory (AAD) as part of [On Behalf Of workflow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow). See instructions below.
- Create an ACS resource through [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=linux&pivots=platform-azp).
- Update the Server (Web API) application with information from the app registrations.

### Set up App Registrations

To register your Client and Server applications, please refer to our [registrations set up guideline](../deploy/set-up-app-registrations.md)

### Create an Azure Communication Services resource

Follow [Quickstart: Create and manage Communication Services resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp) to create an ACS resource using Azure Portal.

### Update the `appSettings.json` File

Before running the sample, you will need to replace the values in the  `appSettings.json`  file:

1. Replace `connectionString` and `scopes` for the Communication Services
2. Replace `clientId`, `tenantId` and `clientSecret` for the Azure Active Directory.

   > Note: Values of `clientId`, `tenantId` and `clientSecret` are all from your `auther-server-sample-webApi`.

### Generate an Azure AD Token Manually

Since the sample does not have a client application, you need to generate a Client Azure AD token manually to make calls to Azure Active Directory protected backend Web APIs in the sample. You will need an access token using client app registration to call the Web API. In order to get the access token manually, please follow the steps [here](../test-tools/generate_aad_token_manually.md). 

>  Note: If you are integrating a client application, then please ignore these steps as you could test directly via user signing through client application.

Once you get the `access_token` in the response, you can jump to the next step to start the server and call `http://localhost:5000/api/token` or `https://localhost:5001/api/token` using the  `access_token`.

### Run the App

In order to run the ACS Authentication Server sample,

1. Go to the project root directory.

   ```shell
   # navigate to the repository
   cd communication-services-authentication-hero-csharp/src
   ```

2. Run the following command.

   ```shell
   # Start the server
   dotnet run
   ```

   > Note: You can also run the selected project using the Visual Studio.

3. Make a GET request to `http://localhost:5000/api/token` with the `access_token` generated at **step 2** of **Generate an Azure AD Token manually** guide as a Authorization Bearer header. Verify you get a response with a successful status code (i.e. 200).

   ```shell
   curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:5000/api/token' --header 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>'
   ```

   > Note: If you are facing issues running the curl command, then try importing (File -> import -> raw text, paste the curl command and continue) the curl command in [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and running it there.

4. During local development/testing, if the identity mapping needs to be verified in Graph for `/api/user` and `/api/token` endpoint, please use [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer). Sign in with your Azure Active Directory Identity and verify the response on GET `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/extensions` endpoint.
