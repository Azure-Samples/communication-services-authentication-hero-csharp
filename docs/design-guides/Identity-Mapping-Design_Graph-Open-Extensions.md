## Scenario

Since Azure Communication Services is an identity-agnostic service, customers need to build trusted backend service that maintains the mapping relationship that their business case requires instead of duplicating information in their system. For example, they can map identities 1:1, 1:N, N:1, N:M.

>External identifiers such as phone numbers, users, devices, applications, and GUIDs can't be used for identity in Azure Communication Services. Access tokens that are generated for an Azure Communication Services identity are used to access primitives such as chat or calling. Know more, please visit [Azure Communication Services Identity Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/identity-model)

## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to utilize Microsoft Graph open extensions as the solution of identity mapping storage to build trusted backend service that will manage ACS identities by mapping them 1:1 with Azure Active Directory identities (for Teams Interop or native ACS calling/chat) and issue ACS tokens.

> Note: 
>
> 1. Developers should not use extensions to store sensitive personally identifiable information, such as account credentials, government identification numbers, cardholder data, financial account data, healthcare information, or sensitive background information.
> 2. Microsoft Graph has two Extension types: [Open extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/extensibility-overview#open-extensions) vs [Schema extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/extensibility-overview#schema-extensions) (**Untyped** data vs **Typed** data). The reason why we use the open extensions here is that we only store simple key-value mapping in this scenario, not typed data.
> 3. It is worth mentioning that maximum **2** **open extensions** are allowed per resource instance while **schema extensions** are **5**. Know more known issues, please visit [Known Extensions Limitations](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/known-issues#extensions)

## The Way How to Manage

As displayed in the ACS Authentication Server - Identity Mapping overview sequence diagram below, the identity mapping part consists of two endpoints - `/user` and `/token`

![ACS Authentication Server - Identity Mapping Sequence Diagram](../images/ACS-Authentication-Server-Sample_Identity-Mapping-Sequence.png)

### User Endpoint

The `/user` endpoint consists of three operations:

1. **GET** - Retrieve the Azure Communication Services identity from Microsoft Graph.
2. **POST** - Add an identity mapping information in Microsoft Graph
3. **DELETE** - Delete an identity mapping information from Microsoft Graph as well as the Azure Communication Services reource.

#### ***GET*** /user

This endpoint is to get the Azure Communication Services identity by given Azure AD ID through Graph open extensions. If there is no related identity mapping stored previously, it will return an error message.

![GET User Endpoint Sequence Diagram](../images/get-user-endpoint-sequence-diagram.png)

1. Get an Azure AD token exchanged via OBO flow. If failing to get an exchanged AAD token through the request *authorization* header, then return an error message:

   ```json
   {
       "code": 500,
       "message": "Fail to get the authorization code from the request header",
       "stack_trace": "Error: Fail to get the authorization code from the request header\n    at Object.getAADTokenViaRequest ..."
   }
   ```

   

2. Use the AAD token to retrieve the identity mapping information from Microsoft Graph by calling `/me?$select=id&$expand=extensions`.

   1. If there is an existing identity mapping information, then return

      ```json
      {
          "acsUserIdentity": "<communication-services-identity>"
      }
      ```

   2. If not, then return an info message

      ```json
      {
          "message": "There is no identity mapping information stored in Microsoft Graph"
      }
      ```
      
   3. If failing to call the Graph retrieving API, then return an error message:

      ```json
      {
          "code": 500,
          "message": "An error occured when retrieving the identity mapping information: <error_message>"
      }
      ```

      

#### ***POST*** /user

This endpoint is to create a Communication Services identity and then add the roaming identity mapping information to the user resource through Graph open extensions. It will return an error message when failing to store the identity mapping information.

![POST User Endpoint Sequence Diagram](../images/post-user-endpoint-sequence-diagram.png)

1. Get an Azure AD token exchanged via OBO flow. If failing to get an exchanged AAD token through the request *authorization* header, then return an error message.

2. Create a Communication Services identity using `createUser`.

   1. if successful, then use the AAD token to add the identity mapping information to the user resource through Graph open extensions by calling `/me/extensions`.

      1. If successful to store, then return

         ```json
         {
             "acsUserIdentity": "<communication-services-identity>"
         }
         ```

      2. If failing to store, then return an error message
   
         ```json
         {
             "code": 500,
             "message": "An error occured when adding the identity mapping information: <error_message>"
         }
         ```
   
   2. If not, then return an error message
   
      ```json
      {
          "code": 500,
          "message": "<message>",
          "stack_trace": "<stack_trace>"
      }
      ```

#### ***DELETE*** /user

This endpoint is to remove the identity mapping from the user's roaming profile information using Graph open extensions.

![DELETE User Endpoint Sequence Diagram](../images/delete-user-endpoint-sequence-diagram.png)

1. Get an Azure AD token exchanged via OBO flow. If failing to get an exchanged AAD token through the request *authorization* header, then return an error message.

2. Retrieve the Communication Services identity from Microsoft Graph.

   1. If successful to retrieve, delete the identity mapping information related to the retrieved identity from Microsoft Graph by calling `/me/extensions/<extensionName>`. 

      1. If successful to remove, delete the ACS user identity from Communication Services resource using `deleteUser` which revokes all active access tokens and prevents users from issuing access tokens for the identity. Also it will remove all the persisted content associated with the identity.

         1. If successful, then return

            ```json
            {
                "message": "Successfully deleted the ACS user identity <communication-services-identity> which revokes all active access tokens and removes all the persisted content, and the identity mapping"
            }
            ```

         2. If not, then return an error message
   
            ```json
            {
                "code": 500,
                "message": "<message>",
                "stack_trace": "<stack_trace>"
            }
            ```

      2. If not, then return an error message

         ```json
         {
             "code": 500,
             "message": "An error occured when deleting the identity mapping information: <error_message>"
         }
         ```
   
   2. If not, then return an error message
   
      ```json
      {
          "code": 500,
          "message": "<message>",
          "stack_trace": "<stack_trace>"
      }
      ```

### Token Endpoint

The `/token` endpoint only consists of one operation - `GET` used to **get** and **refresh** Communication Services tokens

#### ***GET*** /token

When calling the endpoint, the first step is to check if there is an existing identity mapping information stored in Microsoft Graph. If not, a new Communication Services identity will be created and stored by this endpoint.

![GET Token Endpoint Sequence Diagram](../images/get-token-endpoint-sequence-diagram.png)

 Detailed process shows as follow:

1. Get an Azure AD token exchanged via OBO flow. If failing to get an exchanged AAD token through the request *authorization* header, then return an error message.

2. Retrieve the Communication Services identity from Microsoft Graph.

   1. If the identity mapping information exists, create a Communication Services token using `getToken`.

      ```json
      {
          "token": "<communication_services_token>",
          "expiresOn": "<token_expire_time_like_2022-01-10T00:48:44.507Z>"
      }
      ```
   
   2. If no identity mapping information exists, create a Communication Services identity and token `createUserAndToken` first.
   
      1. If failing to create an ACS identity and token, then return an error message.
   
         ```json
         {
             "code": 500,
             "message": "<message>",
             "stack_trace": "<stack_trace>"
         }
         ```
   
      2. If successful to create an ACS identity and token, then add the identity mapping information to the user resource using Graph open extensions.
      
         1. If successful to add, return the Azure Communication Services token to users.
   
            ```json
            {
                "token": "<communication_services_token>",
                "expiresOn": "<token_expire_time_like_2022-01-10T00:48:44.507Z>"
            }
            ```
         
         2. If not, then return an error message.
         
            ```json
            {
                "code": 500,
                "message": "<message>",
                "stack_trace": "<stack_trace>"
            }
            ```
