## Scenario

As you may know, Azure Communication Services SDKs has the ability to allow developers to build custom applications that are usable by Teams users using **Custom Teams Endpoints**. Developers can build custom Teams endpoints to communicate with the Microsoft Teams client or other custom Teams endpoints. With a custom Teams endpoint, they can customize a voice, video, chat, and screen-sharing experience for Teams users.

## Overview

In this Azure Communication Services Authentication Server sample, we would describe how developers can authenticate a Microsoft 365 user by using the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) and retrieving a Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user token. They will then exchange that token for an access token of Teams user with the Azure Communication Services Identity SDK. The access token for Teams user can then be used by the Communication Services Calling SDK to build a custom Teams endpoint.

> 2. When you're in a production environment, we recommend that you implement this exchange mechanism in back-end services, because requests for an exchange are signed with a secret.

## How Token Exchange Works

As displayed in the Azure Communication Services Authentication Server - Token Exchange flow diagram below, the **Token Exchange for single tenant** includes two steps:

1. From the **Client side**, the developer configures the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to authenticate the Microsoft 365 user using the client application registration that should have been created earlier using [application creation steps](../deployment-guides/set-up-app-registrations.md).  This client app registration should have Azure Communication Services **Teams.ManageCalls** permission and this should have been **granted admin consent**, in order to to obtain Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user tokens using **Authorization Code Grant flow**. The MinimalClient added in the sample for testing the backend service apis with UI, demonstrates the authentication flow using client app registration.
2. From the **Server side**, the developer initializes the **Azure Communication Services Identity SDK** and exchanges the incoming Azure Active Directory user token for the access token of Teams user via the identity SDK. The access token of Teams user is then returned to the client application. In the sample, the `/api/token/teams` implements the suggested server side logic.
